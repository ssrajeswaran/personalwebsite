    <h4>What I've learned from crochet!</h4>
    
    <!-- descriptions-->
    <p>Last January, I decided to get into crocheting so I bought a hook and a skein of green yarn. However, I wasn't following a pattern because I thought I was too much of a beginner to make a project, so I decided to start by practicing the basic stitch in crochet - a single crochet. I kept practicing and I got so much better at the stitch until it felt like second nature. But all I ended up creating was one long rectangle of single crochets. It was too wide and short to be a scarf, but too long to be a coaster or placemat. I got busy, and tired of the repetitive stitch, so I stopped, and my crochet hook laid unused for a year and a half.

    <p>A few months ago, I found a Woobles learn-to-crochet kit in an art store, and thought that the little green dinosaur toy would be a great gift for my sister's birthday. I sat for a day and worked on it, and my experience was miles away from the monotony of practicing a single crochet. Each row was a different adventure, and I was learning so much. And sure, it was lumpy and imperfect - but my next project was a little better, and I keep improving every day.
    </p>

    <p>I want to make sure that I take this lesson into my life going forward, especially with working in the lab in biotech. It's scary to start something new and have to apply different techniques before I feel like I've perfected them, not only with regards to lab protocols but also in how I problem solve and offer solutions/next steps in the face of unexpected results. But, it's clear that the only way to learn is by doing. While it may feel better initially to practice and perfect one technique before I start using it, it can lead to monotony, and it's hard to solve problems when I've only got one approach to create a solution. I hope to learn as much as I can about different approaches and different ways of thinking, to try out solutions and deal with failure, to problem solve and find workarounds, and ultimately, to become a better scientist!</p>
